        <h1>Riya</h1>
        <p>Currently pursuing a master's degree in management information systems from UIC. I worked as a data research intern with ISchoolConnect for a year before this. During my internship, my main task was to compile and record university data as well
            as client and internal use case requirements and use cases to make sure the proper solution was created. After graduation, I'd like to work in the data industry, which this internship taught me a lot about in a professionalÂ setting.</p>
