        <p>I am currently pursuing my Master's in Management Information Systems from University of Illinois at Chicago. I have a work experience of 3.6 years as DevOps engineer. I worked on different cloud environments and I'm passionate about automating
            tasks to save human effort. Management Information Systems course has given me a vast exposure on different realt time industry topics and post graduation I would like to apply to roles in projectÂ management.
